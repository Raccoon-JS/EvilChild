# EvilChild
An experimental arthouse game based on a zine of the same name by TaeHee Whang.

It is developed with Godot 3.1.1 and GDScript.

An artist from New York City sent me a message along with the copy of her self-made zine, and commissioned me to adapt it into a game.

She also sent me all of the assets for the zine, and I must obliged to make a game only using these assets.

While brainstorming, I realized there are some skills I am not ready there yet.

I just moved it to Gitea (Not anymore):
